# Install satpi on a Raspberry Pi (Beginner Guide)

This guide is written for beginners. It starts with the hardware, then shows how to prepare a Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi Imager on Windows or macOS, and finally how to install and configure satpi.

Raspberry Pi recommends Raspberry Pi Imager as the standard way to write Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card, and the Imager can preconfigure hostname, user account, Wi-Fi, and SSH for a headless setup.

## 1. What you need

You need:

- a Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 5 (the latter with a cooling fan)
- a suitable power supply for your Raspberry Pi
- a microSD card
- a computer with Windows or macOS
- an internet connection
- an RTL-SDR compatible USB receiver
- an antenna suitable for weather satellite reception
- optionally an LNA and Bias-T if your antenna setup needs it

For a simple headless setup, you do not need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse if you preconfigure the Raspberry Pi image with Raspberry Pi Imager.  [oai_citation:1‡Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 2. Download Raspberry Pi Imager

On your Windows PC or Mac:

1. Open the Raspberry Pi software page.
2. Download **Raspberry Pi Imager** for your system.
3. Install it.

Raspberry Pi describes Raspberry Pi Imager as the quick and easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card.  [oai_citation:2‡Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 3. Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit on the microSD card

1. Insert the microSD card into your computer.
2. Start **Raspberry Pi Imager**.
3. Click **Choose Device** and select your Raspberry Pi model.
4. Click **Choose OS**.
5. Select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**.
6. Click **Choose Storage** and select your microSD card.
7. Click **Next**.

## 4. Configure the image before writing it

When Raspberry Pi Imager asks whether you want to apply OS customisation settings, choose **Edit Settings**.

Set at least the following:

### General
- hostname, for example: `satpi`
- username, for example: `andreas`
- password
- Wi-Fi name
- Wi-Fi password
- Wi-Fi country

### Services
- enable **SSH**

Then save the settings and continue.

Raspberry Pi documents that Raspberry Pi Imager can preconfigure a hostname, user account, network connection, and SSH during imaging, which is ideal for headless setup.  [oai_citation:3‡Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 5. Write the card and boot the Raspberry Pi

1. Click **Write** in Raspberry Pi Imager.
2. Wait until writing has finished.
3. Remove the card from your computer.
4. Insert the card into the Raspberry Pi.
5. Connect:
   - power
   - network, or rely on Wi-Fi if configured
   - RTL-SDR later, not yet required for first boot
6. Wait 1 to 2 minutes for the first boot.

## 6. Connect to the Raspberry Pi with SSH

From your computer, open a terminal.

### On macOS
Use Terminal.

### On Windows
Use PowerShell or PuTTY.

Connect with:

bash
ssh YOUR_USER@HOSTNAME.local

## Quick start after cloning

run /scripts/install_base.sh

Run the commands below after cloning the repository:

bash
cd ~/satpi

cp config/config.example.ini config/config.ini
nano config/config.ini

rclone config

printf "Subject: satpi test\n\nTest mail.\n" | /usr/bin/msmtp you@example.com

python3 bin/test_config.py
python3 bin/update_tle.py
python3 bin/predict_passes.py
python3 bin/schedule_passes.py
python3 bin/generate_refresh_units.py

systemctl list-timers --all | grep satpi

7. Have fun!
